-------------------
-------------------

(1) Perform a run, plot thermo output, visualize the simulation

All commands are shown in README.txt.

-------------------

(2) Add 3 variable commands to simplify setting key flow parameters

The new variable commands at the top of the file should be:

variable    push index 1.0
variable    damp index 0.5
variable    compress index -0.5

The altered fix commands should be:

fix		4 upper aveforce 0.0 ${compress} 0.0
fix		5 flow addforce ${push} 0.0 0.0
fix             6 flow viscous ${damp}

These are the physical effects of the 3 variables on the flow:

"push" variable:
  The larger the push force the faster the flow.
"damp" variable: 
  Counteracts the push variable.  More damping slows and solidifies the flow.
  Less damping allows the flow to be faster and more gas-like.
"compress" variable
  The more negative the value, the narrower the channel becomes.

-------------------

(3) Change the size of the obstacle in the flow

The two region sphere commands will have an altered last numeric
argument which is radius of the sphere.  For example:

region		void sphere 10 4 0 1.01
region		voidout sphere 10 4 0 1 side out

-------------------

(4) Add a second obstacle to the flow

These commmands add a second spherical obstacle of the same size in a
different position:

region		void2 sphere 20 7 0 3.01
region		void2out sphere 20 7 0 3 side out
delete_atoms	region void2
fix             obstacle2 flow wall/region void2out harmonic 100 0 1.12246

These commands add a second spherical obstacle which overlaps
the first one.  It should run fine as well:

region		void2 sphere 14 7 0 4.01
region		void2out sphere 14 7 0 4 side out
delete_atoms	region void2
fix             obstacle2 flow wall/region void2out harmonic 100 0 1.12246

-------------------

(5) Change the obstacle to have a different shape

These new region commands replace the region sphere commands to create
a block-shaped obstacle:

region		void block 9.99 18.01 2.99 7.01 INF INF
region		voidout block 10 18 3 7 INF INF side out

These new region commands replace the region sphere comands to create
a prism-shaped obstacle.  In 2d, a prism is a tilted rectangle:

region		void prism 9.99 18.01 2.99 7.01 INF INF 4 0 0
region		voidout prism 10 18 3 7 INF INF 4 0 0 side out
