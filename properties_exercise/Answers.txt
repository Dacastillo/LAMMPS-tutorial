Answers for Exercise properties

See README.txt for tasks

-------------------
-------------------

(1) Perform a run, plot thermo output, visualize the simulation

All commands are shown in README.txt.

-------------------

(2) Compute the radial distribution function (RDF)

Add commands like these to the "material properties" section of the
input script to compute the RDF, time-average, and output the final average RDF
to the data.rdf file:

compute         myRDF all rdf 50
fix             10 all ave/time 10 2500 25000 c_myRDF[*] &
                file data.rdf mode vector

Plot the 2nd column on the x-axis and the 3rd column on the y-axis
to get a plot that looks like rdf.png.

The "10 2500 25000" values mean compute the RDF every 10 steps,
average it 2500 times, and output the final values every 25000 steps.
For the in.lj script the run is 25000 steps, so one table of RDF
values will be written to data.rdf.  You can try other values
of those 3 numbers as well.

-------------------

(3) Compute the mean-squared displacement (MSD) and diffusion
coefficient

Add commands like these to the "material properties" section of the
input script to compute Dcoeff by a 2-point fit.  The use of 0.001 is
to avoid a divide-by-zero at the first timestep.  The last command
will include the MSD and Dcoeff value in the thermodynamic output:

compute         msd all msd
variable        dcoeff equal c_msd[4]/(step*dt+0.001)/4
thermo_style    custom step temp epair press c_msd[4] v_dcoeff

EXTRA: Adding these commands will also compute Dfit by fitting to a
vector for the entire time-history of MSD values.  The last command
will include Dfit in the thermodynamic output:

fix             11 all vector 1000 c_msd[4]
variable        dfit equal slope(f_11)/(1000*dt)/4
thermo_style    custom step temp epair press c_msd[4] v_dcoeff v_dfit
thermo_style    custom step temp epair press c_msd[4] v_dcoeff v_dfit

-------------------

(4) Compute and colorize defects for a solid state system

Change the rho value to 1.0.

These commands will colorize defects for both individual cnum.*.jpg
snapshots and a cnum.mpg movie:

compute         cnum all coord/atom cutoff 1.5

dump		4 all image 500 cnum.*.jpg c_cnum type &
		zoom 1.6 adiam 1.0
dump_modify	4 pad 5

dump		5 all movie 500 cnum.mpg c_cnum type &
		zoom 1.6 adiam 1.0
dump_modify	5 pad 5

The value of 1.5 in the compute coord/atom commmand is a good cutoff
length to capture first neighbors in a 2d LJ solid for a hexagonal
lattice.

-------------------

(5) Compute the viscosity (eta) for a liquid system

Because of its relative complexity, all the instructions for this task
are in README.txt.
