Answers for Exercise basic

See REAMDE.txt for tasks

-------------------
-------------------

(1) Perform a run, plot thermo output, visualize the simulation

All commands are shown in README.txt.

-------------------

(2) Change size of the asperities

Here is an example that makes one of the 2 half-spheres larger,
by changing the last argument from 8 to 10:

region		lo-asperity sphere 32 7 0 10
region		hi-asperity sphere 18 15 0 8

-------------------

(3) Run for two cycles instead of one

The run command for this is

run		40000

-------------------

(4) Change the shape of the asperities

All commands are already included in the input script.

Comment out these 4 commands:

#region		lo-asperity sphere 32 7 0 8
#region		hi-asperity sphere 18 15 0 8
#region		lo-bump intersect 2 lo-asperity above-lo
#region		hi-bump intersect 2 hi-asperity below-hi

Un-comment these 2 commands:

region		lo-bump block 28 36 7.8 12 INF INF
region		hi-bump block 14 22 10 14.8 INF INF

-------------------

(5) Run on two-processors and compare timing to one-processor run

See these lines in the log.lammps file:

1 proc: Loop time of 5.48112 on 1 procs for 20000 steps with 1724 atoms
2 procs: Loop time of 3.58445 on 2 procs for 20000 steps with 1724 atoms

Examining the timing breakout will tell you what sped up and what did not.
